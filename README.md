# Investigating the Effects of Light Pollution on the Bat-Moth Evolutionary Arms Race

## Description

This project explores the influence of artificial light on the evolutionary dynamics between bats and moths, two species engaged in a longstanding evolutionary arms race. The study simulates interactions between bat and moth populations under conditions of light and darkness using a genetic algorithm to model their co-evolutionary processes. The research aims to assess the vulnerability of moths under artificial lighting and examine potential adaptive responses in their defensive strategies.
